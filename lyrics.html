			<h1>Already Taken</h1>
			<h3><i>Song by Trey Songz</i></h3>
			Every night up in the club<br>
			Getting money with the thugs<br>
			Thought I never fall in love<br>
			And then there was you<br>
			And I don't want to be a player no more<br>
			Every night in the club gettin' with a different girl<br>
			Thought I'd never fall in love<br>
			Then I met you<br>
			Girl you changed my mind
